# Android code for Neo assistant
Neo is a mobile application for real-time AI-driven tech support. The app is supported by a backend that uses an inference algorithm with a crowdsourced knowledge base to compute solutions. The knowledge about a technical issue gets shared across users using our expert system which can perform root cause analysis and match it up with a possible fix in the knowledge base. Providing solution customized for userâ€™s device and navigating complex settings to apply such a solution are two key components of our approach.
